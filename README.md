## Accelerometer

The accelerometer measures acceleration:

> In physics, acceleration is the rate of change of velocity over time. In one dimension, acceleration is the rate at which something speeds up or slows down.


* Positive values indicate an increase in velocity.
* Negative values indicate an decrease in velocity.
* Zero values indicate constant velocity (which might not be zero).
